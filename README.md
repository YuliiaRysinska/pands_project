# About Project
This Project built on the basis of the acquired knowledge of the course "Programming and Scripting", teacher Andrew Beatty, ATU. 
This Project explore differences between species with regards to the features measured through desciptive statistics, graphs and statistical tests, implement a classification approach, identify which features were the most informative and assess the accuracy of the approach
and identify relationships between features both across and within species, and test for the strength and statisical significance of these relationships.

# About Iris Data Set 
The Project concerns the well-known Fisherâ€™s Iris data set which considered a classic data set for use in statistics. The data set contains 150 objects of three different classes and four features: three species of North American Iris flower: setosa, virginica and versicolor with 50 numeric values per species of sepal length and width, and petal length and width.
